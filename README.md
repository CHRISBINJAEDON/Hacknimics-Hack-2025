## 🧠 Project Overview

**PhantomBank** (Smart Safety for Forest-Edge Economies) is an eco-friendly, handheld smart deterrent device designed to reduce **human–wildlife conflict** in rural and forest-edge communities. It integrates **AI, IoT, and blockchain** to create a scalable, data-driven safety and financial resilience network.

The project empowers rural households to:
- Protect crops and livestock safely  
- Log wildlife incidents in real time  
- Enable verified insurance and compensation  
- Support SDG-aligned rural innovation

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Over **400 million people** live near forests in India, where human–animal conflict causes annual losses exceeding ₹1,000 crore. Traditional deterrents (crackers, fire, solar fences) are unsafe and expensive.  
We wanted to build a **safe, affordable, and sustainable** solution that empowers local communities — aligned with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals**.

---

## 💰 Economic Problem Addressed

- Crop and livestock loss due to wildlife intrusion  
- Delayed or inadequate compensation  
- Insurance gaps and lack of verified proof  
- Poor resource allocation by forest departments  

Our device and data-driven system improve **financial inclusion** and **economic resilience** for vulnerable communities.

---

## 🎯 Target Users

- Rural farmers and forest-edge communities  
- Forest departments & wildlife NGOs  
- Rural insurance programs  
- Local governance and data agencies  

**Use Cases:**
- Night-time protection  
- Automated wildlife alerts  
- Verified digital reporting  
- Real-time dashboards for agencies

## 🔍 How It Works

The **Smart Torch Device** emits:
- Red LED flashes (repelling light frequency)  
- Artificial flame visuals  
- Non-harmful sound deterrents  

The connected app allows villagers to:
1. Log wildlife incidents with time, species & location  
2. Upload verified data to a blockchain ledger  
3. Trigger predictive AI-based alerts  

**Impact:**
- Reduces crop loss by up to **60%**  
- Lowers compensation claims by **₹15,000 per household**  
- Enables real-time coordination between villagers and forest departments  

---

## 📊 Economic Modeling Dashboard

The dashboard visualizes:
- Savings per household  
- Reduction in claims and losses  
- ROI for NGOs and local governments  
- GIS-based wildlife intrusion heatmaps  

Powered by open datasets from **FSI**, **PM-KISAN**, and **World Bank** rural reports.

---

## 📈 Data-Driven Features

- **Incident Logging App** – Easy data entry by villagers  
- **Blockchain Ledger** – Transparent proof for compensation  
- **Analytics Dashboard** – Real-time conflict visualization  
- **Predictive AI Alerts** – Early warning of animal movement  
- **Insurance Integration** – Supports fast claim validation  

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- Simulating deterrent effects without pollution or fire hazards  
- Ensuring affordability for low-income regions  
- Creating an offline-first IoT + blockchain hybrid model  

Our solution balances **safety, cost-effectiveness, and environmental care**.
